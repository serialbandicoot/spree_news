SpreeNews
=========

*** Forked from original ***

This is an extension for Spree 1.0 that allows an Admin to create and manage posts in the admin panel. Posts that are marked as published will show up on the home page in a news ticker window that uses jquery to slide between posts. If there are no published posts, the news ticker window will not show up on the home page. Changed location to the top of the page and changed the js using http://www.makemineatriple.com/2012/03/downloads-news-ticker-jquery-plugin many thanks to Bryan Gullan for the excellent ticker


Installation
=======

Create a new rails/spree app:

    rails new mystore
    cd mystore
    spree install (might require running 'gem install spree' first)

Then add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'spree_news', :git => 'git://github.com/samtreweek/spree_news.git'
    gem 'haml'

Then install the extension and start the server:

    bundle install
    rails g spree_news:install (select 'yes' to run migrations)
    rails s

Depending on your project environment, you may need to clean your assets to make sure the JS and CSS load for the spree_news extension. Do this if the news ticker looks unstyled and the JS does not work:

    rake assets:clean


Usage
=======

To use, go to /admin and select the 'posts' tab. Create a new post with a title and description and select the 'published' check box to make it appear on the home page.

Once created, navigate to '/' to see the news ticker show up below the products.
